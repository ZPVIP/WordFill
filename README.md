# WordFill

# How to play

WordFill is an engaging fill-in-the-blank game that challenges you to complete sentences by correctly guessing missing words. Each sentence is presented with one or more blanks, and your task is to type in the missing word(s) that best complete the sentence.

## Instructions
- **Guessing Words**: Simply type your guess for the missing word into the provided space. If your guess is incorrect, a red cross will appear next to the sentence to indicate a wrong answer. Conversely, if your guess is correct, the sentence will automatically update to reveal the next challenge.

- **Random Mode**: For those who prefer a non-linear approach, you can enable the "Random" mode by checking the "Random" checkbox. This feature shuffles the order of the sentences, offering a more unpredictable and varied gameplay experience.
- **Hint**: If you're stuck on a particular sentence, you can click the "Hint" button or `Ctrl + h` to reveal the missing word.
